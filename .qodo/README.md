# Personal System TODO Management

## Overview
This directory contains the task management system for your personal knowledge management and automation system. All identified work, improvements, and action items are tracked here with priorities and dependencies.

## File Structure
- `tasks.json` - Main task database with all current TODOs
- `README.md` - This documentation file
- `archive/` - Completed tasks moved here for reference

## Task Structure
Each task includes:
- **id**: Unique identifier
- **content**: Brief task description
- **status**: pending, in_progress, completed
- **priority**: high, medium, low
- **category**: Features, Improvements, Maintenance, Documentation, Integration, Bug Fixes
- **created**: Timestamp when task was created
- **updated**: Last modification timestamp
- **description**: Detailed explanation
- **estimated_effort**: Time estimate
- **dependencies**: List of task IDs that must be completed first

## Priority Levels
- **High**: Critical for system functionality or user experience
- **Medium**: Important improvements or features
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features or maintenance tasks

## Integration Points
- **Telegram Bot**: `/tasks` command shows prioritized task list
- **Daily Summary**: Includes task status and recommendations
- **Weekly Review**: Task progress review and planning
- **Shadow Work**: Tasks can be tagged with shadow archetype connections

## Adding New Tasks
1. Use the `todo_write` tool in Cursor AI conversations
2. Tasks are automatically added to `tasks.json`
3. Include priority, category, and dependencies
4. Update status as work progresses

## Viewing Tasks
- **All Tasks**: Check `tasks.json` directly
- **Via Bot**: Use `/tasks` command in Telegram
- **By Priority**: Filter by high/medium/low
- **By Category**: Group by Features, Maintenance, etc.

## Task Lifecycle
1. **Identified** → Added to system with pending status
2. **Started** → Marked as in_progress
3. **Completed** → Marked as completed and moved to archive
4. **Archived** → Kept for reference and learning

## Best Practices
- Break large tasks into smaller subtasks
- Update effort estimates based on actual time spent
- Link related tasks with dependencies
- Review and reprioritize weekly
- Celebrate task completions as progress markers

## Current Status
- **Total Tasks**: 8
- **Pending**: 8
- **In Progress**: 0
- **Completed**: 0
- **High Priority**: 2
- **Medium Priority**: 4
- **Low Priority**: 2

This system ensures nothing falls through the cracks and provides visibility into your personal development and system improvement journey.
