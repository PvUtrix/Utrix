# Genetic Data

## Purpose
This directory contains structured genetic data, mutations, risk assessments, and related health metrics in machine-readable formats for analysis and monitoring.

## Contents
- `genetic_mutations.yaml` - Structured genetic test results and risk factors
- `family_history/` - Family genetic patterns and inheritance data
- `risk_assessments/` - Genetic risk calculations and trends
- `monitoring_data/` - Ongoing genetic health monitoring metrics

## Usage
- Store genetic data in structured formats (YAML, JSON)
- Track genetic risk factors over time
- Generate reports and insights from genetic data
- Export data for healthcare providers and analysis
- Monitor trends in genetic health markers

## Data Structure
The genetic data follows a standardized format:
- **Subject Information**: Personal details and test metadata
- **Pathogenic Mutations**: Detected genetic mutations and implications
- **High Risk Factors**: Elevated risk assessments for various conditions
- **Condition Likelihoods**: Probability assessments for specific health conditions
- **Recommendations**: Medical and lifestyle recommendations
- **Follow-up Schedule**: Monitoring and consultation timelines

## Privacy Considerations
- All genetic data is highly sensitive and confidential
- Access should be restricted to authorized personnel only
- Data should be encrypted when stored or transmitted
- Regular review of access permissions required
