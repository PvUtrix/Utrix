# Domains

## Purpose
The domains directory organizes your life into distinct areas of focus, each with its own management system, goals, and resources. This separation allows for focused attention on specific life areas while maintaining connections between them.

## Contents
- `career/` - Professional development, skills, network, and opportunities
- `health/` - Physical and mental health, nutrition, workouts, and medical data
- `finance/` - Budgeting, investments, planning, and tax management
- `learning/` - Courses, books, skills development, and knowledge acquisition
- `startups/` - Business ideas, venture investing, and startup management
- `relationships/` - Personal and professional relationship management
- `creativity/` - Creative projects and artistic pursuits
- `my-startups/` - Personal startup ventures and business projects
- `venture_investing/` - Investment strategies and portfolio management

## Usage
Each domain operates as a self-contained system with its own:
- Goals and objectives
- Progress tracking
- Resource management
- Workflow integration
- Automation scripts

Domains can be managed independently but should be reviewed together during weekly/monthly planning sessions to ensure alignment with overall life goals.
