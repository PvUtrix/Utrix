# Getting Started Guide

Welcome to your new Personal System! This guide will help you get oriented.

## 1. The Core Idea
This system is designed to be a "second brain" and an automation hub. It's a place to store what you know, manage what you do, and automate repetitive tasks.

## 2. Key Directories
-   **/core**: This is about you. Your values, your vision. Start here.
-   **/knowledge**: Your personal wiki. Store notes, summaries, and ideas here.
-   **/domains**: The different areas of your life (Health, Finance, etc.). This is where you track progress.
-   **/projects**: For specific, time-bound initiatives with clear goals.
-   **/automation**: Holds the scripts that make your system work for you.

## 3. First Actions
1.  **Personalize `/core`**: Spend 30 minutes filling out your values and vision. This will be your compass.
2.  **Review `/domains`**: Delete any domains that aren't relevant to you. Add any that are missing.
3.  **Create Your First Project**: Copy `templates/project_template.md` into `projects/` and start your first project.
