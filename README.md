# Personal Knowledge & Automation System

A privacy-first, individual-centric system for managing personal knowledge, projects, and automation across all life domains.

## 🎯 Philosophy

This system is built on the principle that **you come first**. Your identity, values, and goals form the foundation, with everything else - projects, domains, and interests - building upon that core.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Setup Your Identity**: Start by filling out `core/identity/intro.md`, `core/identity/values.md` and `core/identity/goals.md`
2. **Choose Your Domains**: Activate the domains relevant to your life in the `domains/` folder
3. **Configure Privacy**: Review `.gitignore` and set up your `privacy/local/` folder
4. **Customize AI Rules**: Adjust `.cursorrules` files for your preferences
5. **Start Documenting**: Begin with daily notes in `core/workflows/daily.md`

## 📁 Structure Overview

```
personal-system/
├── core/           # Your identity, knowledge, and workflows
│   └── identity/   # intro.md, values.md, goals.md, strengths.md
├── domains/        # Life domains (health, finance, career, etc.)
├── projects/       # Active and archived projects

├── resources/      # Templates and references
├── privacy/        # Secure, private data
└── docs/          # System documentation
```

## 🔒 Privacy First

- **Local by default**: Sensitive data stays in `privacy/local/` (never synced)
- **Encrypted options**: Use `privacy/encrypted/` for cloud-safe storage
- **Domain privacy**: Each domain has `.private/` folders for sensitive data

## 🎨 Customization

This system is designed to evolve with you:
- Add new domains as needed
- Create custom workflows
- Build your own automation scripts
- Develop project templates
