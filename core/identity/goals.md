# Life Goals & Vision

## Life Vision Statement

In 10 years, I live as a global entrepreneur-philosopher who has scaled Tango.Vision and Innovators.Moscow into billion-dollar ecosystems that empower property owners and communities to build sustainable, human-centered environments. My life is abundant, free, and adventurous: I snowboard and cycle across the world, spend summers hosting festivals of innovators, and balance wealth with meaningful contribution. I am financially independent, respected as a thought leader on fairness and sustainability in tech, and surrounded by deep relationships with people I love and trust.
