# Decision Making Principles

This document outlines the frameworks and principles I use to make effective decisions.

## Guiding Principles
1.  **Clarity over Certainty**: I don't need to be 100% certain, but I must be clear about the problem I'm solving and the desired outcome.
2.  **Reversibility**: I classify decisions as "one-way doors" (hard to reverse) or "two-way doors" (easy to reverse). I agonize less over two-way door decisions.
3.  **Seek Disagreement**: I actively seek out dissenting opinions to challenge my assumptions and see blind spots.
4.  **Long-term Orientation**: I optimize for long-term value, even if it means short-term discomfort.

## Frameworks

### The 10/10/10 Rule
I consider the consequences of a decision on three time horizons:
-   How will I feel about it in **10 minutes**?
-   How will I feel about it in **10 months**?
-   How will I feel about it in **10 years**?

### The Eisenhower Matrix
For prioritizing tasks and decisions:
-   **Urgent & Important**: Do it now.
-   **Important, Not Urgent**: Schedule it.
-   **Urgent, Not Important**: Delegate it.
-   **Neither**: Eliminate it.
