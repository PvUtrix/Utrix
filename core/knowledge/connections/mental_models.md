# Mental Models

Mental models are frameworks for thinking that help simplify complexity and make sense of the world.

## Key Models

### 1. First-Principles Thinking
-   **Description**: Breaking down a problem into its most basic, fundamental truths and reasoning up from there. The opposite of reasoning by analogy.
-   **Use Case**: Solving complex problems, innovation, challenging the status quo.
-   **Question**: "What are the fundamental truths or assumptions here?"

### 2. Second-Order Thinking
-   **Description**: Thinking beyond the immediate result of a decision and considering the second- and third-order consequences.
-   **Use Case**: Decision making, strategy, avoiding unintended negative outcomes.
-   **Question**: "And then what?"

### 3. Inversion
-   **Description**: Approaching a problem or goal by considering the opposite. Instead of "How can I succeed?", ask "What could cause me to fail?".
-   **Use Case**: Risk management, problem-solving, achieving goals by avoiding pitfalls.
-   **Question**: "What would guarantee failure here?"

### 4. Circle of Competence
-   **Description**: The idea that each of us has areas of deep knowledge and other areas where we have little. It's crucial to know the boundaries of your own circle.
-   **Use Case**: Investment, decision making, knowing when to seek expert advice.
-   **Question**: "Am I operating within my circle of competence here?"
