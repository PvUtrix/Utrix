# Book Summary: Atomic Habits by James Clear

## Core Idea
Small, incremental changes (1% improvements) compound over time to produce remarkable results. Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.

## The Four Laws of Behavior Change

### 1. Make it Obvious (Cue)
-   **Goal**: To make the cues for good habits readily apparent.
-   **Techniques**: Habit Stacking (linking a new habit to an existing one), Environment Design (making cues visible).

### 2. Make it Attractive (Craving)
-   **Goal**: To make the habit more appealing and desirable.
-   **Techniques**: Temptation Bundling (pairing an action you *want* to do with an action you *need* to do).

### 3. Make it Easy (Response)
-   **Goal**: To reduce the friction associated with performing the habit.
-   **Techniques**: The Two-Minute Rule (start a new habit by doing it for just two minutes), Automate habits where possible.

### 4. Make it Satisfying (Reward)
-   **Goal**: To provide immediate reinforcement for the habit.
-   **Techniques**: Habit Tracking (visual proof of progress), immediate rewards.
