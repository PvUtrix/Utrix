# Sales Funnels

## Key Concept
A sales funnel represents the journey a customer takes from initial awareness of your brand to making a purchase.

## Stages (AIDA Model)
1.  **Awareness**: The prospect becomes aware of your product or service. (e.g., Blog posts, social media, ads)
2.  **Interest**: The prospect expresses interest and seeks more information. (e.g., Subscribing to a newsletter, downloading an ebook)
3.  **Desire**: The prospect develops a desire for the product. (e.g., Case studies, webinars, product demos)
4.  **Action**: The prospect takes the final step to purchase. (e.g., Pricing page, free trial, consultation call)

## Metrics to Track
-   **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of users who move from one stage to the next.
-   **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Total cost of sales and marketing to acquire one new customer.
-   **Lifetime Value (LTV)**: Total revenue a business can expect from a single customer account.
