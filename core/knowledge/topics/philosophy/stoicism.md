# Stoicism

## Core Tenets
Stoicism is an ancient Greek school of philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium. It teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions.

1.  **The Dichotomy of Control**: Some things are within our control, and some are not. We should focus our energy only on what we can control (our thoughts, judgments, and actions).
2.  **Virtue is the Sole Good**: The highest good is living a life of virtue (courage, justice, temperance, wisdom). External things like health, wealth, and pleasure are indifferent.
3.  **Live According to Nature**: Live in harmony with the rational order of the universe and accept what happens.

## Key Figures
