# Project Idea: Automated Meal Planner

## Problem
-   It's time-consuming to plan healthy meals for the week.
-   It's hard to create variety while sticking to dietary goals.
-   Grocery shopping lists are tedious to create.

## Solution
An automated script that generates a weekly meal plan based on:
-   Dietary preferences (e.g., high-protein, low-carb)
-   A database of favorite recipes
-   Available cooking time per day

The script would also auto-generate a categorized grocery list.

## Potential Features
-   Integration with grocery delivery APIs.
-   Nutrition tracking (calories, macros).
-   "Use up leftovers" feature to reduce food waste.
