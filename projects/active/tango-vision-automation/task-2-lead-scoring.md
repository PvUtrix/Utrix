# Task 2: Create Automated Lead Scoring System

## Objective
Build an automated lead scoring system that ranks leads based on engagement and qualification criteria.

## Time Estimate
4 hours

## Prerequisites
- Task 1 completed (sales process audit)
- Access to current lead data and CRM system

## Steps to Complete

### Step 1: Define Scoring Criteria (60 minutes)
1. **Engagement Score (0-50 points)**
   - Website visits: 5 points per visit
   - Email opens: 2 points per open
   - Email clicks: 5 points per click
   - Demo requests: 20 points
   - Phone calls: 15 points

2. **Qualification Score (0-50 points)**
   - Company size: 10 points if 50+ employees
   - Budget range: 15 points if $10k+ budget
   - Decision timeline: 10 points if <3 months
   - Authority level: 15 points if decision maker

3. **Total Score**: 0-100 points
   - 80-100: Hot lead (immediate follow-up)
   - 60-79: Warm lead (schedule follow-up)
   - 40-59: Cold lead (nurture sequence)
   - 0-39: Unqualified (archive or nurture)

### Step 2: Set Up Data Collection (90 minutes)
1. **Website Tracking**
   - Install Google Analytics or similar
   - Track page visits, time on site, downloads
   - Set up conversion tracking for demo requests

2. **Email Tracking**
   - Use email marketing tool (Mailchimp, HubSpot, etc.)
   - Track opens, clicks, and engagement
   - Set up automated sequences

3. **CRM Integration**
   - Connect all data sources to CRM
   - Set up automated data syncing
   - Create lead scoring fields

### Step 3: Build Scoring Logic (90 minutes)
1. **Create Scoring Algorithm**
   - Use existing automation scripts as template
   - Build Python script to calculate scores
   - Set up automated scoring triggers

2. **Set Up Automation Rules**
   - Hot leads: Immediate notification + call
   - Warm leads: Add to follow-up sequence
   - Cold leads: Add to nurture sequence
   - Unqualified: Archive or remove

### Step 4: Test and Iterate (60 minutes)
1. **Test with Historical Data**
   - Run scoring on past leads
   - Compare scores to actual outcomes
   - Adjust scoring criteria as needed

2. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Track scoring accuracy
   - Monitor conversion rates by score
   - Set up alerts for high-scoring leads

## Deliverables
1. **Scoring Algorithm**: Working lead scoring system
2. **Automation Rules**: Automated actions based on scores
3. **Dashboard**: Real-time lead scoring dashboard
4. **Documentation**: How to use and maintain the system

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Lead scoring system is live and working
- [ ] Automated actions trigger based on scores
- [ ] Dashboard shows real-time lead scores
- [ ] System is documented and team is trained

## Expected ROI
- 25% improvement in lead conversion rates
- 50% reduction in time spent on unqualified leads
- 2-3 hours saved per week on manual lead qualification

## Next Steps
After completing this task, move to Task 3: Build automated email follow-up sequences
