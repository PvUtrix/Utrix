# üõ†Ô∏è Automation Tools

This directory contains specialized tools and utilities for automating various aspects of your personal system.

## üìÅ Tool Organization

Each tool is organized in its own subdirectory for better maintainability and organization:

### üßπ Cleanup System
**Location**: `cleanup/`
**Purpose**: Automated file cleanup and repository maintenance
**Key Features**:
- Smart detection of temporary files, test files, and build artifacts
- Safe backup system before removal
- Interactive and automatic cleanup modes
- Git hooks integration for pre-commit cleanup

**Quick Start**:
```bash
# Interactive cleanup menu
python3 automation/tools/cleanup/cleanup.py

# Preview what would be cleaned
python3 automation/tools/cleanup/automated_cleanup.py --dry-run

# Install git hooks for automatic cleanup
./automation/tools/cleanup/setup_cleanup_hooks.sh
```

**Documentation**: See `cleanup/README.md` for complete documentation.

## üéØ Tool Development Guidelines

When adding new tools to this directory:

### 1. **Create a Dedicated Folder**
```bash
mkdir automation/tools/your_tool_name/
```

### 2. **Include Required Files**
- `README.md` - Complete documentation
- `config.yaml` or `config.json` - Configuration file
- `main.py` or `your_tool.py` - Main script
- `setup.sh` - Installation/setup script (if needed)

### 3. **Follow Naming Conventions**
- Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores
- Keep tool names short but clear
- Use consistent file extensions (.py, .sh, .yaml, .md)

### 4. **Documentation Standards**
Each tool should include:
- **Purpose** - What the tool does and why it exists
- **Quick Start** - How to run the tool immediately
- **Configuration** - How to customize the tool
- **Examples** - Common usage patterns
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

### 5. **Integration Points**
- Tools should be self-contained but integrate with the broader system
- Use consistent configuration patterns
- Provide both interactive and automated modes
- Include proper error handling and logging
